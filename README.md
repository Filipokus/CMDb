# BjornRoth CMDb
It's been a blast working together to achive this final product. Before you clone the project, make sure to read this!

## CMDb API Info
We are referencing the CMDb API in the three following files:
* AppSettings.json
* site.js
* topList.js

To test our webb service you need to have the *latest* version of CMDb API installed and **running** in the background.
The references in the three files listed above need to be set to the localhost where you are running CMDb API.

## And Lastly...
Enjoy our CMDb solution! We enjoyed building it :D
